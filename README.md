# Disposable Email Providers

## What:
This repo provides and easily accessable list of disposable email providers for use in things like vetting user signups.

## How:
We combine several other maintained disposable email provider lists and cross-reference them looking for cominalities.  
Using a configurable 'minimum-sightings' it will tell you which domains appear in at least 'minimum-sightings' differnet lists.
